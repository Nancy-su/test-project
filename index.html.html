Rules of hijab for men

According to the Qur'an, both men and women should dress in ways that are halaal, meaning permissible, throughout their lives.
 According to the traditional view in Sunni Islam, men must cover from their belly buttons to their knees, though they differ on whether this includes covering the navel and knees or only what is between them. It is also mentioned in the Qur'an that it is haraam for men to wear clothing articles made of silk or animal skinned that has not been tanned. Conversely, men are permitted to wear anything made of wool, camel hair, or goat hair. It is explicitly taught that men should not wear clothing that is see-through or that doesn't cover body parts that are considered intimate, known as â€˜awrah. Lastly, it is not halaal for men to wear clothing that is similar to or imitates clothing that a woman would wear. [14]
